# Photon-microwave-emitter
This program was designed to measure the change in flourencence of optically excited nitrogen vecacy centeres within nano-diamonds during electron spin 
megnetic resonance.

</n>This program is designed to be used with a SG380 Series RF signal generator and a photon counter/(APD). GBIP commands are used to interact with these instruments.

</n>This code was written in professor Horowitz Lab at Hamilton College.
